	3 - Can I sync between devices ? If so how ? Mega ? Github ? External device ?
	4 - Can I load pass to the clipboard ?
	5 - How do I store everything on a SQLite table ?

Objectives:

	- Use PKDF with Script ( https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/protocol/kdf.html#scrypt ) to generate key to create ChaCha20 cipher (key must be 32 bit size)
	- Can be used step-by-step with console gui or with only argument passed was the script is called
